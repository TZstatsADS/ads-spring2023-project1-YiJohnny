# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy by YI SUN

### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

The graphs generated during processing and some pictures I used for word clouds are here. Thank you for reading!

Best,
Yi Sun
